# Overview and Support Added 

```
This project demonstrate a lot of C++ Programming language and extend this Snake game, following the principles I've learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate my independency to create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

The game now have new feature which is make the game more chalanging, by develope difficlty to the player, after eating food seven times the speed of the snake go up and the snake wont be able to go accross the wall, and the wall change color and become clear it can not be crossed, as well as the game ask the player if he/she want to play again, and finally create a log file.
additionally the background of the game has been add by using SDL sub module for Images.

# Explanation

## (1) Understaing of C++ and OOP  
```
The project code was already organized into classes with class and spicifier attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks, add to exesiting classes more clsses to extend the game to more functionalty and make it interactive. 
--> Demonstrated in class "Player" and class "Log" which was added
```

## (2) User inputs
```
The code accepts input from the user, and depending on it the execution flows to certian direction
--> Clear demonstrated in the file player.cpp in the loop
```

## (3) Read/Write deta from/to files
```
The prject successfully write (dump) data from programm execution to a file as log file. 
--> Deonstreated in class "Log" which has been added.
```

## (4) Reference usage
```
The project code reference to define varuible, as well as passing parameter to function by reference
--> Demonstrated in the new "Player" class
```

## (5) Access Specifier 
```
All claass members are orgnized explicitly between public, protected and private, including the new added classes. 
--> Demonstrated in the new "Player" and "Log" classes
```

## (6) Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces
```
All class member functions describe their functionality, either through function names or comments. 
--> Demonstrated all over the project and also in classes "Player" and "Log" 
```
